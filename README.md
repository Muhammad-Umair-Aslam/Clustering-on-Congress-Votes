# Clustering-on-Congress-Votes
We have a csv file that contains all the votes from the 114th Senate. Each row contains the votes of an individual senator. Votes are coded as 0 for “No”, 1 for “Yes”, and 0.5 for “Abstain”. There are different columns having the bills, the party, and the state of each senator. Lets see how clustering will be applied on this data set.
